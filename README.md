# E-commerce Back End ORM

## Description
If I were a manager at an internet retail company, I would want a back end for my e-commerce companies. I learned how to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. I also learned how to source the schema and run the seeds through the command line. I was also able to learn more about using Insomnia. I familiarized myself with get, post, put, and delete routes.

## Installation
Run npm i to install the packages and dependencies

## Usage
Start my logging into MySQL in the integrated terminal. Then source the schema. Afterwards, quit MySQL and npm run seed so the database is seeded with test data. After running npm start, use Insomnia to run the routes.
